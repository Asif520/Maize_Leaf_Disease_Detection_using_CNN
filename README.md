#** "Maize_Leaf_Disease_Detection_using_CNN"** 
This is a research based project that I've done for my **"Final Defense of B.Sc" **. 
Here The dataset is downloaded from Kaggle dataset. There are 3 types of infected images of maize leaves and healthy type.
Used CNN model to train the model. Used 80% data for training, 5 % for Validation & 15% for Testing. 
I got 98.36% accuracy . The image prediction confidence is almost 100% for all test images.
